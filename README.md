# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
credit card fraud detection using ML algorithms: Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting on an imbalanced dataset. Explored model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score both with and without SMOTE. Identified Random Forest as the most robust algorithm, maintaining high accuracy and balanced precision-recall trade-off


# Overview
This repository contains code for detecting credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on analyzing an imbalanced dataset to predict fraudulent transactions. Three primary algorithms, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, were implemented and evaluated for their performance.

 # Features
- Utilizes Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting classifiers
- Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient
- Comparison of model performance with and without SMOTE technique for handling imbalanced data

# Contents
- Jupyter notebooks for implementing and evaluating each algorithm
- Dataset used for training and testing the models
- Python scripts demonstrating model evaluation and comparison

 # Results
- Random Forest exhibited superior performance in accuracy and balanced precision-recall trade-off, particularly after applying the SMOTE technique.
- AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting showed improvements in capturing fraudulent cases post-SMOTE but suffered in precision.

# Usage
- Clone the repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the implementation.
- Data files are included, and the Python scripts detail model evaluation and comparison.
- Adjust hyperparameters or explore additional algorithms to further enhance detection accuracy.

 # Future Improvements
- Explore ensemble methods or fine-tuning techniques to boost the performance of AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.
- Investigate other methods to handle imbalanced data apart from SMOTE for potentially improved results.
