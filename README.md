# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
credit card fraud detection using ML algorithms: Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting on an imbalanced dataset. Explored model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score both with and without SMOTE. Identified Random Forest as the most robust algorithm, maintaining high accuracy and balanced precision-recall trade-off
